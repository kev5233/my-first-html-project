The Contents of this Repository Contain a WebBrowser Music Player Written in Html, CSS and Javascript feel free to use and improve upon the code
This is my 1st Project in my Journey of Software Engineering Bootcamp so the Functions are limited to loading your cover art, Artist, Song Name and audio files you input in Javascript/main.js
Thers a progress bar which displays the Current Track Time and also allows you to skip to certain times of the track
it also has Play/Pause, SkipForward, SkipBack Fuction The Shuffle and Repeat Buttons are not yet functional. In a future version once ive learned more about Javascript 
i can update them. The Music Player also Contains a Navigation Bar that links to a Log-In Page, Sign-Up Page AND Homepage.
The Search Bar Routes You to Google.com. I hope this will help someone who maybe like me is just starting there Journey into Coding or maybe remind you Vet's that have
been doing coding a long time of your 1st project.
